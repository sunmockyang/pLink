# pLink
Perhaps a websocket based visualization? idk

View project [here](http://sunmockyang.github.io/pLink/).

Code base was used in [this visualizer](https://github.com/sunmockyang/github-visualizer), and has officially moved on as the basis of [a canvas engine](https://github.com/sunmockyang/canvas-engine).
